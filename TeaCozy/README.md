Codecademy Project #2

- the images of "Featured Teas" are huge compared to the size used in the website. In real life I would resize them, but here it was part of task to be able to resize on the webpage
- the redline file is not proportional or is not showing the real sizes.
    -The Locations div has to have height of 500px, but the size of picture on redline has a height about 650px. I made the site with 500px
    - In Location div the distance between the text "Locations" and the boxes below should be 15px and the horizontal distance between the boxes should be 40px. But on redline those distances are almost identical.
    - There are lot of distances are not signed with such text. In those cases I tried to create my webpage to be similar to redline (this is the oppsite I did in the previous two points)
- the "opacity: 0.9" on redline is about which element? In some phase I applied it to H2 and H4 (eg. in Mission div), it looked great, but finally decided to apply it only on BODY
- I intentionally did not consolidate style.css, I mean a number of identical CSS properties are in there (like "display: flex;"). For me this way is more readable and editable. I made a try for that in MyTimes projects (https://hanselmus.github.io/mytime/)
